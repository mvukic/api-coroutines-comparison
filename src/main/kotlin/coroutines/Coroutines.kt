/**
 * # Coroutines:
 *
 * 1) Kotlin de facto concurrency library
 * 2) Made by the same people that created Kotlin
 * 3) Default solution for concurrent tasks on Android
 *      - it is not going anywhere
 * 4) Represents structured concurrency
 *      - adds clarity, quality to concurrent programming
 *      - concurrency
 *          - two or more tasks can start, run and complete in overlapping time (not necessarily the same time)
 *          - multitasking on single core machines
 *      - parallelism
 *          - tasks are run at the same time
 *          - multi core processors
 *  5) CompletableFuture/Webflux differences
 *      - no operators
 *      - no chained one liners
 *      - sequential code
 *  6) Kotlin compiler
 *      - each coroutine is compiled to a state in a larger finite state machine
 *  7) Exceptions
 *      - using regular try/catch or whatever
 *      - easy propagation of those exceptions
 *  8) Supported by Spring Boot (MVC and Webflux)
 *      - controller return type support (MVC, Webflux)
 *  9) Easily used with existing solutions
 *      - because it is basically a library
 *      - adapters for CompletableFuture
 *          - .await() extension
 *          - builders to transform coroutines to CompletableFuture
 *      - adapters for Reactor
 *          - .await(), .awaitFirst(), .awaitFirstOrDefault() extension
 *          - builders for transforming coroutines to Reactor types
 *  10) Api is simple
 *      -  ~5 keywords
 *  11) Can be canceled
 *  12) Coroutines are used from within coroutine context
 *      - functions that create coroutines are prefixed with suspend keyword
 *      - jobs can are run from within async { ... } block
 */

/**
 * 1) suspendable computations -> the idea that a function can suspend its execution at some point and resume later on
 * 2) coroutines are light-weight threads
 * 3) The function signature remains exactly the same. The only difference is suspend being added to it. The return type however is the type we want to be returned
 * 4) The code is still written as if we were writing synchronous code, top-down, without the need of any special syntax (except async to launch the job)
 * 5) The programming model and APIs remain the same. We can continue to use loops, exception handling, etc. and there's no need to learn a complete set of new APIs
 * 6) Go language has the same thing
 * 7) Most of the functionality is delegated to library
